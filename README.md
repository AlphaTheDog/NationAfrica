## ðŸ”§ Tools & Skills Used

- `requests` â€” for making HTTP requests
- `BeautifulSoup` â€” for parsing and navigating HTML
- `urllib.parse` â€” for building full URLs
- `pandas` â€” for tabular data storage and CSV export
- `Custom headers` to bypass basic anti-bot detection

## ðŸ’¾ Output

The scraped data is saved in a CSV file for further analysis or reporting. Each row contains a news article with its associated metadata.

## âœ… What This Project Demonstrates

- Safe and ethical web scraping practices
- HTML structure navigation using `bs4`
- Working with modern websites that use dynamic content and anti-bot measures
